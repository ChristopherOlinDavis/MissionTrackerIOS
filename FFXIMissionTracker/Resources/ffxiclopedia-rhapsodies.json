          "description": "Click the ??? a second time for the fight with Siren. She has very high defense, and poor resistance to magic. She is healed by wind elemental damage. Weak to piercing damage. Uses Entice, a frontal cone Charm. This does not affect Trust NPCs, but they will be dismissed if charm takes effect on a soloing player. As a result, if you are soloing with Trusts, have at least one of them be the tank to turn Siren's attention away from you. Uses Lunatic Voice throughout fight, make sure to bring a way to remove silence. Uses Clarsach Call at 25% HP, an Astral Flow-like ability which does 900-1100 damage over a large area. Be prepared to mitigate this. Recommended level of 90+ if solo (including with Trusts). If you have a consistent source of magic damage, you should have only moderate difficulty at level 75 (or possibly earlier). Can be won as a 81 RDM/DNC with 4 trusts. Note that Alter Egos will prioritize wind spells due to an error in their AI, causing them to heal Siren. Reverberation and Light skillchains will also cause Siren to be healed. Can be won in extremis (14 minutes) as a 75 DRG/SAM with wyvern, 4 trusts (Trion, Teodor, Apururu, and Koru-Moru) and a 75 adventuring fellow (fierce attacker style). Artifact armor, best polearm, strength-boosting items and food, high merits, and constant use of certain abilities/skills as soon as they're available (Deep Breathing, Hasso, Jump, High Jump, Meditate, and Impulse Drive) should work, but you might have to retry several times (if things get out of hand, run to the nearby Grotto and zone, heal with your wyvern and fellow, and come back). Despawns after 15 minutes.",

NOTE: Numerous Aht Urhgan missions lock you from finishing this mission. Consult this list. Once you get this cutscene, it's strongly recommended you finish up to Uncertain Destinations before continuing Treasures of Aht Urhgan. If you have only just started Treasures of Aht Urhgan, it will take approximately 1.5 to 2 hours to get up to mission 12, most of it being cutscenes with only one long travel section.

There may be a glitch where if someone defeats Balamor, other people can join the party after the fight, click the ???, and still get the next cutscene and credit for the win, without fighting.",

The enemies are several levels above level 120 when you check their strength, but once engaged during this quest they lower in level to Easy Prey. They are from the strong Naraka family. They are level ~125 prior to engaging, level ~107 once pulled with a party member on this quest. They aggro sound and low HP, but do not link, making it possible to pull them one at a time using ranged attacks or magic. Make sure you do not wander too close to the black pixies that also roam around the area. They aggro and will not be weakened by the Rhapsody in Mauve (they will not cure you either, and defeating them does not affect pixie hate). You cannot zone before killing all three or the counter will reset. The door doesn't track your progress; it always says you must defeat three when you examine the door. Note: on 03/14/21 time ran out at 0400 and I'd only killed 2 Narkuuls. I logged off by the Etched Rock and came bak about 2100 the same V. Day. The counter did not reset as expected. I killed one of what I thought would be 3 Narkuuls needed and the battle was normal. But then I killed a second one and the Rhapsody in Mauve did not reset its level downward and it was a tough fight. Having killed 2 previously counted and clicking on the Etched Rock completed the Mission. So I did not need 3 more after logging. Just the one I was lacking. It's a good idea to not kill more than 3.",
