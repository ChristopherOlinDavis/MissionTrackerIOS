Another option is to use the Proto-waypoint to Castle Oztroja. Travel to Castle Oztroja. Yagudo along the path go up to level 49 and will sight aggro players under level 68 unless they are Invisible. Go through the door at (I-8) to reach Map 3. One lever opens the door, and the other triggers the trapdoor. You will not be able to throw a lever unless you are standing on the trapdoor. The correct lever changes every Vana'diel day. Since there is a significant delay, an easy way to avoid the trap is to throw a lever and then immediately run off of the trapdoor. Enter Map 7 via exit F at (G-7). Enter Map 2 via exit I at (I-7). Light the Yagudo Torch at (H-9/10) to open the Brass Door. Open the Brass Door at (G-10). Continue into Altar Room. Check the Magicite at the end of the hall. Shard of Optistone - Davoi (Monastic Cavern) The fastest way is to book warp by Survival Guide to Norvallen, Davoi. Another option is to use the Proto-waypoint to Davoi. Travel to Davoi. Orcs along the path go up to level 39 and will sight-Aggro to players under level 55 unless they are Invisible. Wolf Bats are level 25-29 and will hearing-Aggro players under level 43 unless they are Sneaked. Disable the Wall of Dark Arts (G-7). Continue into Monastic Cavern. A friend with the Crest of Davoi can Tractor you through the Wall. Check the Magicite at the end of the hall. Shard of Aurastone - Beadeaux (Qulun Dome) The fastest way is to book warp by Survival Guide to Derfland, Beadeaux. Another option is to use the Proto-waypoint to Beadeaux. Travel to Beadeaux. Quadav along the path go up to level 28 and will hearing-Aggro to players under level 42 unless they are Sneaked. Enter Map 2 via exit A at (H-7). Enter Qulun Dome at (I-7). Open the door. If you get the message \"The Silver bell, Coruscant rosary, Black Matinee Necklace, glow faintly.\" then move closer and try again. A friend with the Silver bell, Coruscant rosary, and Black Matinee Necklace can Tractor you through the door. As there are no mobs in Qulun Dome, you will need to use Poison Potions to kill yourself first. Check the Magicite at the end of the hall. (All of these are in the same locations as the Magicite mission. If you are on the Magicite mission, you will receive the respective shard first; clicking on the stone again will lead to the respective cutscene and finally receiving the Magicite.)",

As a Gaze Attack, it can be avoided by turning away from the lynx. Petrifactive Breath - AoE attack inflicting 5-10 second petrification. Frenzied Rage - Attack Boost Charged Whisker - Deals Lightning damage in a radial area of effect. Blink of Peril -Gaze Attack, avoidable by facing away from the lynx, that reduces the target's HP to 1% and minimizes hate, similar to Throat Stab. May be capable of knocking a character out according to some reports (See the discussion page). Can be stunned, but the lynx can repeat the move as soon as stun wears off. This ability takes about 3 seconds for the lynx to execute after readying it. Vulnerable to Repose and Light Shot. The lynx can be spawned 5 minutes after the last one was defeated.

I just fed him 2 Pipiras in a row and he took them. Contrary to Romaa Mihgo's hint, a Mihgo Mithkabob will not work, so you must collect some of the fish.",

This results in a shorter cut-scene than the two methods below, but they all end the same way. (Note that even if you get the shorter cutscene, you'll still see the longer version if you view it via the Goblin Footprint later.) Feed him all three of Forest Carp, Pipira and Greedie. I fed him two Pipira and a Greedie, so it seems any combination of 3 fish will satisfy his hunger. Feed him one Blackened Muddy Siredon.",
