          "description": "Use the Gun of Trials until the latent effect disappears. You must accumulate 300 total Weapon Skill Points by performing Weapon Skills on experience-yielding monsters. You cannot earn points by participating in Campaign Battles or Besieged, because those monsters do not directly grant experience points. The Weapon Skills must be performed by this particular gun; using a melee Weapon Skill with this gun merely equipped does not count. Weapon Skills performed while under Level Sync count. Weapon Skills performed in Reives will count. You receive 5 points for opening/soloing a weaponskill, 7 points for closing a Lv.1 Skillchain, 9 points for closing a Lv.2 Skillchain and 11 points for closing a level 3 Skillchain. No message is given when the latent effect is lost. To check if the latent effect has disappeared, simply check if you have the bonus stats; if not, you are done. It is not necessary to unequip the gun for the latent effect to disappear; the stats disappear immediately upon acquiring the 300th WS point. Note your Elemental Resistance bonuses from the weapon: they will be gone if the latent is broken.",
