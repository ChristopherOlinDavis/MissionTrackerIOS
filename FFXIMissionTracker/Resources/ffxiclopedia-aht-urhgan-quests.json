You can warp right to the entrance using an Atmacite Refiner if you've started the Aht Urhgan Voidwatch path. You can also warp to the entrance if you've activated the Survival Guide at the entrance. You will need a Lamian Fang Key (or a Thief) to open an Iron Gate inside Arrapago Reef. You may farm this key either in Caedarva Mire or Arrapago Reef, or can obtain one by checking a ??? in Caedarva Mire (I-7), on a small ledge behind a Jnun. A character can obtain a free Lamian Fang Key once per Vana'diel day (resets at 0:00 game time) and they can be sent between characters on the same PlayOnline account. [Note: you will technically need TWO Lamian Fang Keys (or use the other option), one to flag and one to \"finish\"]. You do not need a Lamian Fang Key to get to the ???. Using the Ilrusi Atoll Staging Point will get you to Map 2. From there, go to point A to get to Map 1. Then go to the tunnels using point m. That puts you at the same spot as if you used the Lamian Fang Key with the method above. Exit using the lower left Iron Gate to get to the ???. (Note: There are Soulflayers along this route that are True Hearing. There are also Heraldic Imps in the cave right next to the staging point that are True Sight. Going this way is NOT ideal for your level 40 Corsair and you would be wise to have reraise.) Another somewhat faster and safer way if the Voidwatch warp isn't available is to bring someone along with escape to Ilrusi Atoll Staging Point. From there cast Escape and you'll end up near the entrance to Arrapago Reef in Caedarva Mire. You still need to get a Lamian Fang Key, but you skip walking past the True Sight mobs.",

If you end up killing the NM without intimidating it, you still get two guesses at its weakness when you report back the the NPC. Example: No element intimidated the Mamool Ja NM. The peculiar bud scent did not intimidate him. Dropping off the ledge did not intimidate him. Eventually, he died, never getting intimidated. So I guessed that the weaknesses were: 1) a weapon skill from a certain angle, because solo, trying weapon skills from different angles was very difficult, and I only managed two different angles during the fight. 2) a specific weapon skill, because I obviously did not use every weapon skill in the game against him. I wasn't even able to use all my sword skills. I got the first weakness correct (certain angle), completing the quest, and receiving 200 Imperial Standing. I was wrong about the second weakness: I suspect that Shining Blade was not considered light element damage, or that the bud scent or dropping off the cliff didn't work out for some reason.",
