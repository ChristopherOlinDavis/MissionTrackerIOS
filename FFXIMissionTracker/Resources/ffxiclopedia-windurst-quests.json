This can be done by using an outpost teleport into the zone. This can be done by using the Survival Guide teleport into the zone. This can be done by teleporting into the zone (Teleport-Dem, Nexus Cape, etc). This can be done by traveling into the zone using a Cavernous Maw. You can zone into an area under Monstrosity and still receive the weather cutscene and credit. See Odyssean Passage for a list of applicable areas. Weather Checker NPCs in each town or city can help predict when and where the weather for which you are looking will be in effect. Bear in mind, however, that these Weather Checkers are not completely accurate; some weather effects may occur on days they are not forecasted, and vice-versa.

These can be purchased off the Auction House, under Other/Misc, or hunted down yourself. Enter Inner Horutoto Ruins from East Sarutabaruta (J-7), go through one of the cracked walls at either (G-8) or (G-9). Continue through the tunnel section until you reach the Magic Door at (D-10). Follow through to next crack, keep going until you see a Sealed portal at (H-9). To open the door, you need a party of 3 mages, a WHM, a RDM, and a BLM. Or someone with a Portal Charm-permanent key item. Alternatively, you may take the path through Toraimarai Canal, however, this will require the Key Item Rhinostery Certificate obtained from the quest Toraimarai Turmoil. From the Priming Gate entrance at (H-3) in Windurst Walls, follow the stairs down, make a right, and go down the small stairs on the right-hand side.After this make a right, then a left. When you reach the Horutoto Ruins section of the canal (keep an eye out for Makara) go straight, right, left, left. You are looking for a small stairwell, take it up. Cross the small bridge and follow the path as far as it goes. Once in Inner Horutoto Ruins, go through the door marked \"Toraimarai Canal\" and fight the Wendigo to your heart's content. Head to (H-7), the tunnels that lead there look like dead ends, but keep walking and your character will be able to go through them. The room behind the tunnels is where you will find the Wendigos. These will drop the Test Answers.",
