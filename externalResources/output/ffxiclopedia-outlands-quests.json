          "description": "He requests a Saber Shoot and Opal Silk, which can be obtained via the Inside the Belly quest involving Zaldon. Saber Shoot can be obtained by trading Gugrusaurus to Zaldon. Gugrusaurus bite on the Ship bound for Mhaura and Ship bound for Selbina during pirate attacks, on the Manaclipper during the routes to and from Purgonorgo Isle that are closest to Purgonorgo Isle, as well as on the Open sea route to Al Zahbi and Open sea route to Mhaura (no special requirements for these ferries). Gugrusaurus bite on Meatball and Drill Calamary. Drill Calamary can be obtained from the Inside the Belly quest by trading Sea Zombies to Zaldon. Occasionally the Pirate's Chart Quest also yields a Drill Calamary. Drill Calamary are a common Repeat Login Campaign item for 100 login points each from the Greeter Moogle. Gugrusaurus can be obtained from the mog garden Coastal Fishing Net. Opal Silk can be obtained by trading Lik to Zaldon. Lik can be caught in Leremieu Lagoon in Lufaise Meadows. Lik bite on Minnow and Dwarf Pugil. Dwarf Pugils can be obtained by trading a Cave Cherax to Zaldon. Occasionally the Brigand's Chart Quest or the Pirate's Chart Quest will also yield a Dwarf Pugil. They now can also be gotten for 100 monthly login points each from the Greeter Moogle. Lik can be obtained from the mog garden Pond Dredger.",

Killing the Leeches is not required for the completion of the quest; they can be avoided by applying Sneak. The leeches can be slept while you wait the 5 minutes as well(by you or someone outside of your party and kited to Zeruhn Mines zone. SCH/RDM does well with this using the JA to make SleepII and Gravit become -ga.) I stood in the furthest corner of the eastern spring and when sneak ran out, I just slept the leech (as 75RDM/37BLM). As long as you are out of range of the other leeches to link, this works wonderfully.",
