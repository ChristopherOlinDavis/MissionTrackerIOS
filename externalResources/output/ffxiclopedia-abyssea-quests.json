          "description": "Travel to three Dark Fissures and toss in the grenades to destroy the Abyssean threat. One of the Dark Fissures (H-6) is located on the valley floor in the same chasm as the Central Encampment; travel further down the ramp and look for a group of Pasture Funguars, nearby is the Dark Fissure. The other two Dark Fissures are located in the chasm at (F-6) & (F-7), the same chasm which would normally lead to Ordelle's Caves, travel to the valley floor once more and continue on the pathway to Ordelle's Caves, along the way you will see two Dark Fissures. Occasionally when using the anti-Abyssean grenades on the Dark Fissures, you may receive a message declaring that you have destroyed one of the Abyssean creatures residing inside; you will receive experience points (~221-350) for the monster you destroyed. The probability of this event is unknown; however, it is not necessary for completion of the quest. Defeating a monster gives the following text, even if damage display in the log is turned off: (Name) casts anti-Abyssean grenade #0X into the fissure.The anti-Abyssean grenade scores a critical hit!The unidentified creature takes 9999 damage.(Name) defeats the unidentified creature.(Name) gains 350 experience points. Beware of the Pasture Funguar and the Cankercap (sound) and Hadal Gigas (sight) enroute to completing this quest.",

The Chocobo has a distinct pattern, usually a dash, then a long look away, then a small trot, quickly followed by a turn (don't try during this phase as it always turns as you come up to it then back to the dash, repeated.) It also only walks/runs to 4 locations around the Spoor and will only face particular directions at each spot, using this information it's pattern is easily observed, once you get it, it becomes laughingly easy to catch. If you approach when it is facing you, it will say, \"Kweh!?\", be spooked, and run off to a new location. The Chocobo may randomly run deep into the Coeurls or chasm tunnels and disappear. There are two \"levels\" of spooking the chocobo. If you click it while its looking at you, it will say \"Kweeeh Kweeeh!\" and run away, to my experience into the Coeurls. The \"Kweeeh Kweeh\" message is received if you click the chocobo after it is already spooked. if you get the Kweh Kweh message twice before it de-spawns it will stop and go back to the normal area. you can have another chance to finish the quest if it does not see you on the way back. If this happens, you must obtain a new bunch of Gysahl Greens on your own to try again. Changing area does not reset it. Having some Gysahl Greens in store makes unnecessary running around unneeded. Alternatively, one could accept the Resistance Operation Desert Rain II (Attohwa) or Ward Warden II (Attohwa) and purchase more Gysahl Greens from the Chocobo Tamer.",

Shortly (within 2-4 seconds), NPCs named \"Resistance Fighter\" will start very rapidly sliding down the slope, dropping to the left or right of the hole in the ledge face. Tarutaru seem to fall quickest, while Galka seem to be the slowest. You must select them and click on them as they are near you on the ledge. If you are successful, the NPC will scurry up into the hole and disappear down the tunnel. If you fail, they will fall out of sight and vanish. They will come in waves of 2-3 NPCs spaced 1-2 seconds apart followed by a pause of about 3 seconds.",

          "description": "You will see a dragon skeleton and a number of Excavation Points around the area. Like Mining points, they may only last one or two attempts to dig up the item. The points move around this area, and there can be three excavation points up at any one time. You need to keep excavating using your Pickaxes until you get the Hardened Bone. NOTE: You may not receive the Hardened Bone the first time, so it is recommended to bring more pickaxes. You may break many pickaxes and obtain several items unrelated to the quest, so be sure you have inventory space or be willing to discard items.",
