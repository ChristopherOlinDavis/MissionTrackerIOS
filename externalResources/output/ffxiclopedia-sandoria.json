The battle can be won solo, on certain jobs. (Most - if not all - jobs can easily solo this by subbing Scholar.) (see testimonials) A maximum of 6 characters that are currently on the mission, or have previously completed it (may have switched allegiance even), will be allowed to enter the battlefield. Buffs will wear off upon entering. There is no Experience Points loss upon defeat. On the battlefield, you will find 3 Orcs and 2 Warmachines: Darokbok of Clan Reaper (PLD) Derakbak of Clan Wolf (DRG) Jagidbod of Clan Reaper (RNG) Reaper Clan Warmachine Wolf Clan Warmachine Attacking even one of them will aggravate them all regardless of how it is done. All of them are level 68. The Orcs have ~4000 HP, the Warmachines have ~1800, and the Wyvern ~1000. It is not necessary to defeat the Orc Dragoon's Wyvern to finish the Fight and get the cutscene, it can stay slept the whole time. All of them are susceptible to both Sleep and Lullaby, however Darokbok of Clan Reaper is more resistant due to its Resist Sleep trait; they can be slept using Elemental Seal + Sleepga II/Sleepga, or Horde Lullaby. The Orcs will use their respective 1-hrs when they get below 50% health.",
