          "description": "(Upper Jeuno G-7) Wait for the Vana'diel day to change. Speak with Laila again for a cutscene where you perform for real. You must be on DNC to trigger this CS. Audience is composed of 3 children, 2 young men/women, and 2 older people. Focus on Jigs and Waltzes so at least 5 of 7 will watch your performance and you'll win for sure. If you succeed, you will be rewarded with the Dancer's Casaque. You must have at least half of the audience (4 people) watching Brilioth to complete this quest. The actual performance is significantly more difficult than the practice. Even after the clock hits 0:00, there is still about a 5-second window (while the next cutscene is loading) that Valeriano can steal your audience and you are unable to do anything about it. If the actual performance is failed, you must wait one more game day and zone before you may try again. Simply alternating Waltzes and Jigs quickly enough guarantees a win. Get to each one as fast as possible (for example, after a Jig, start pressing [Enter] to do a Waltz immediately).",

You must ride close to the food to consume it (clicking not required). The food will disappear. Your raptor will have heart icons around it's head. A message will print to the chat log letting you know how many more points you need to visit to complete the quest, or whether you should now seek out Syrillia. A small amount of \"Motivation\" and \"Pep\". Mini-game mechanics: \"Motivation\" & \"Pep\" meters. Motivation decreases over time At about 50%, mount loses speed. Motivation reduces faster over steep hills, indicated by a red \"!\" and sweat marks. Pep slowly regenerates over time Is converted into Motivation via /cheer. Indicated by yellow musical notes on your mount. Once you have spoken to Syrillia at the end of the course, you will be automatically returned to Upper Jeuno. If you run out of time or Dismount, you will be given several options: Try again, Try again at a lowered difficulty, or Give up. Lowering the difficulty does not affect the quest rewards, increases the time limit to 30 minutes, and changes the Motivation meter to drain more slowly and the Pep meter to fill more quickly.",

          "description": "Obtain six food items: Bison Steak, San d'Orian Tea, Icecap Rolanberry, White Bread, Whitefish Stew, and Windurst Salad. Except for the Bison Steak, all of them are sold by merchants, depending on the national Conquest Ranking. All items can be purchased from AH under food. Take note that you may end up spending around 20-35k gil. The most expensive item, Whitefish Stew, can cost 9k if Windurst is in last place! Sometimes NPC prices are cheaper, sometimes more expensive, than AH. Bison Steak may be somewhat difficult to obtain if it's a rarely-sold item on your server's AH and you don't have enough skill in cooking to make it yourself. All of these items can be crafted for around 9k assuming you or a friend has cooking at a high-enough level. If crafted, the items must match requested items. HQ versions will not work. Glyke (Upper Jeuno Merchant located behind the Marble Bridge Door) sells White Bread and Windurst Salad cheaply. You can target her from outside and still buy these items. The appropriate camera angle and positioning of your character is required to target her from outside. Simply rotate your camera and mash ENTER or whatever you use to accept until it doesn't say: \"The target is out of range.\"",
