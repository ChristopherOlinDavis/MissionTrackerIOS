In the first phase he will begin in a stance that grants him magic immunity. Every 5 minutes or after taking 1000 damage, he will change between magic stance and melee stance, which gives him physical immunity. In magic stance he will primarily use tier 2 elemental spells and debuffs. He tends to use the weaponskill Dark Nova when he is about to switch to melee stance. In melee stance he uses the weaponskills Giga Slash, Kick Back, and Umbra Smash. Monks can use Formless Strikes to bypass his physical immunity. A cutscene will play after you defeat his first phase. He will immediately attack you in phase two. In this phase he will spam Implosion. If you are attempting this fight with a lower-level party, it is typically best to zerg him.
