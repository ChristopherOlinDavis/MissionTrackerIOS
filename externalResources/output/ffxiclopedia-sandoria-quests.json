Only Pupadi Dollmohr needs to be defeated to win the fight. Trusts and other players who are on or past this quest can aid in the battle. Tuffle-Buffle and Musto-Rusto will attempt to hinder you by dying. If they die, you will fail the fight. Tuffle-Buffle spams -ga II and -ga III nukes, while Musto-Rusto casts single-target enfeebling spells such as Paralyze and Slow. Tuffle-Buffle's and Musto-Rusto's attacks generate extreme amounts of enmity, so Tuffle-Buffle will likely tank all three NMs with his weak -ga spells. Fabioso uses the Blue Mage ability Unbridled Wisdom, and Celestin uses the Red Mage ability Chainspell. Fabioso seems to favor Area of Effect spells while under Wisdom. Can use Unbridled Learning to use one other spell, notably Absolute Terror. Fabioso can also use Charm, causing you to kill one of the Tarus extremely fast. Both Fabioso and Celestin are susceptible to gravity. Untested on Pupadi Dollmohr but probably its too. Subduction can inflict heavy gravity on all of them so that you can safely kite.",

Using Quickstep and Desperate Flourish will also help your accuracy during the fight. Laila will randomly use the Weapon Skills Shadowstitch, Viper Bite, Cyclone, Dancing Edge, or Shark Bite periodically when switching off between Steps and Flourishes of her own. Laila will cure herself using Curing Waltz for ~96 HP. She will also use either Drain Samba or Haste Samba. Due to the unusual survivability of this enemy, Hi-Potions are suggested, as you need all the TP you can get for Dancing Edges of your own. Note that it is not necessary to drop Laila to 0% to win the fight; roughly bringing her to 20% will end the battle. Similar to Maat, Laila will perform multiple Weapon Skills in a very short time period to instantly finish the battle if your time is close to ending.",

Lullaby may work. Yazquhl and Gowam may share hate. You can kite one and kill one; however, if a kiting pet or player comes too close, the kiter may draw aggro. For example, during one fight Yazquhl turned on Carbuncle and used a weaponskill while it was kiting Gowam. Carbuncle had done nothing to draw aggro (no AoE blood pacts were used). Susceptible to Gravity and Bind. Their elemental weaponskills ignore shadows. This includes Red Lotus Blade , Burning Blade , Seraph Blade , and Shining Blade. Circle Blade erases shadows. Yazquhl uses Mighty Strikes at about 50-60% HP. Gowam uses Azure Lore at 50% HP and begin to spam spells, but he is easily interrupted with regular hits or Stun. They skillchain together so if you decide to take on both at once beware. Keep them apart. (see testimonials)",

I suggest NOT tabbing around, but rather to set the camera to as much of bird's eye view as possible, and to look for the sparkle of the Rockhopper on the ground. You must be fairly close to the spot to get the Rockhopper, else you will get a \"Target out of range.\" message. Walking around while clapping is a viable strategy, but you must spot and click the Rockhopper target quickly. \"/clap motion\" does work to draw out the Rockhopper. As this is a fairly popular experience spot, consider macroing this instead of just using /clap. typing /clap and using the up key is of course more than fast enough. Clap fast, no time to lose.",

You only get the map after finishing all the non-Batallia/Sauromugue monuments. Speaking to Abelard any time after receiving Selbina Clay, but before trading a Clay Tablet, triggers a hint. He mentions not receiving a tablet from any area you have not yet brought him one from. This is a good way to keep track of monuments without a checklist.

The first time you play for each guard, you receive a small 10 gil reward (until you have played for both guards.

Call all guards together - Luto Mewrilah or Miledo-Shiraddo captured. How is Salim doing? - Goes away to check on Salim. Gentle Tiger - Used Lead Guardsman's ID All options are same as for Militant Gale, but you get the exact opposite results! Take a break - Luto Mewrilah or Miledo-Shiraddo captured. Guard another spot - Leaves to guard another spot. Call all guards together - Leaves to call them together. How is Salim doing? - Luto Mewrilah or Miledo-Shiraddo captured. Lucky Charm -> Key Ring Belt Pocket Watch -> Hermes Quencher Scope -> Silent Oil. Allows you to see which NPCs are safe to talk to for hints; useless if you're reading this page. Don't use on hint NPCs or you can miss out on getting one. Snare -> Hi-Ether You are given several locations in which to lay the snares. This will stop the guards from even challenging your attempts to press the switches, should you place a snare at the location where a switch is. Hint: Put the snares in each of the three switch locations. The \"all clear\" will be automatic each time you press a switch. The snares cannot be deactivated throughout the quest.",

Relatively weak hits, 10-30 shielded, 60-90 unshielded on a decently geared paladin. Has decent Accuracy; hit an Item Level NIN about 75% of the time. Has a strong Additional Effect: Lightning Damage effect on attacks, which seems to disappear when it uses Thunderbolt. Quite posibly a non elemental effect or not affected by magic resistance/ magic defense. 90-108 damage per activation with 0 Mdef and thunder resist, and 90-108 Damage per activation with +180 thunder resist & +20 Mdef. Frequently uses Thunderbolt which is aoe stun (used almost everytime after a blue magic spell was used on it). Frequently uses Shock Wave (cone attack that goes through shadows and has a mild knockback effect). Damage dependant on the number of times it uses Howl (varies 90~900). His TP move Howl seems to boost the damage dealt by Shock Wave. As the fight progresses the Young Behemoth will begin spamming Howl. It seems to have a cumulative effect (like stacking Boost) accounting for the increased damage dealt by Shock Wave. Dispel is recommended. Dispelling Howl had no effect on shockwave damage. Damage done, though, was related to the number of Howls used between each shockwave. Has somewhat high defense. Has very high evasion. (ACC food for melee a must). His evasion will not be an issue to an Item Level character. Has little to no MDB, nukes do full damage. The average Thunder IV did ~880 for 5% HP.",

Unlike previous quests, Brygid will accept both standard and HQ (+1) versions of gear. I.E. both a Orison Cap or a Orison Cap +1 will initiate the quest, and if she requests for you to wear a Scorpion Harness, a Scorpion Harness +1 will also fulfill the requirement. If you cannot find or obtain a piece of the equipment she asks for, you can talk to her again and she'll ask if you want to continue or quit. Electing to quit will remove the quest from your 'current' logs. You will have to rezone and talk to her again to redo/restart the quest, which will then randomize another pair of gear.",
