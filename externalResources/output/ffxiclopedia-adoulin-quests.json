          "description": "Equip the Trial Wand in your main hand and perform weapon skills with it to obtain Weapon Skill Points. 300 Weapon Skill Points are needed. Trust: Ayame uses weapon skills that elementally coordinate with the weapon skill last used by a player, functioning as a skillchain initiator. She is extremely convenient for quests that involve performing skillchains. [1] If you use Black Halo, Trust: Ayame begins using Tachi: Kasha every time both you and Ayame have at least 1000 TP, allowing you to perform frequent Light (Skillchain)s for maximum WS points. If you choose this option, be sure to pick targets of reasonable strength. Marjami Ravine or Yorcia Weald may be good options. Bight Uragnites right outside of Western Adoulin work well due to their extremely high physical defense. An excellent setup is to have Trust: Ayame and non-combative support Trusts fight with you against Serpopard Ninlil via Unity NM. Trust: Cherukiki keeps Haste active on the player. The Espial Gambison Set is recommended for an easy-to-acquire, Item level 117 melee DD set for Geomancer.",

It will stay at 1 HP until doing this, so there's no need to stun it. The bomb must be kept dispelled, otherwise it will self-destruct. It will use blaze spikes and berserk; if these are left on for more than a few seconds, it will use self-destruct! Self-Destruct is triggered as a counter-measure if Incensed Pineapple HP drops too fast, preventing massive zergs or conduit strats. In fact, a SMN conduiting the NM right from the start will eventually trigger Self-Destruction pretty early in the burn, while a controlled low-medium DPS will have little to no problem in this fight. While Self-Destruct is more related to how fast the NM dies, keeping it dispelled is essential because it has very high magic attack, dropping almost 90% of Amchuchu's HP in a single Fire V, what would be expected in high Lv NM in game, and not a quest NM. That's a hint that you need to keep it dispelled so the NM will constantly recast Blaze-Spike and Berserk, making it pretty much harmless in terms of danger.
