You need some form of Sneak to avoid aggro from the Antica and Sabotenders in the caves. There is a Grounds Tome at the entrance where you can get Circumspection. Travel towards (I-9) and step on the circular pad to open door. This pad requires a total weight value of 3 to open or a Loadstone. Weight values are as follows: Galka = 3 weight units, Hume/Mithra/Elvaan = 2 units, Tarutaru = 1 weight unit. Possession of the key item Loadstone will also open weight-triggered doors in Quicksand Caves. Head west and step on the pad at (H-7) to open next door. Enter the next room and drop down the hole in the floor at (F-7). This drops you into a hidden area. Hug the left wall with Sneak up until you reach the Chamber of Oracles zone at (D-4).",

The fastest way to reach K-8 is via Proto-Waypoint to Quicksand Caves if you registered it during the quest Further Founts. Otherwise, warp to Quicksand Caves Home Point #1, navigate through the hidden parts of the map to H-4, then zone out to Western Altepa. After exiting Quicksand Caves, drop from the ledge and climb out of the pit that you are currently in, up to the ground level of the desert. This saves the time spent running to D-12 from Rabao. Head to an unmapped pathway at the canyon walls in Western Altepa Desert at the SW corner of D-11, which will lead you to an open area with an entrance to Quicksand Caves. The entrance is located in the trench at D-12. Head to K-8 and stand on the pressure plate to open the door to the east. Exit through D on the map, which is on L-8. The weight sensor requires 1 Galka, 3 Tarutaru, or 2 of any other combination to trigger. Alternatively, any single character with a Loadstone can enter. On the next map, go through the weight sensor door at G-8. Walk through the door and fall down into the pit at I-8. Touch the ??? on a pillar right where you landed at I-8 and select Yes to spawn the Ancient Vessel (See testimonials for further notes.) Once the Ancient Vessel is killed, inspect the ??? again to dig out the Scrap of Papyrus. If you zone after killing the Ancient Vessel without obtaining the Scrap of Papyrus, you must redo the fight to obtain the Scrap of Papyrus. If someone has recently completed this, or you fail and come right back, you may get a \"You sense faint traces of magic force\" error. There will be a delay before you can fight it again.",
